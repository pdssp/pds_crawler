    Mission Overview
    ================

      The Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) spacecraft was launched from
      the Cape Canaveral Air Station in Florida on 7 November 1996
      aboard a Delta-2/7925 rocket.  The 1062-kilogram spacecraft,
      built by Lockheed Martin Astronautics, traveled nearly 750
      million kilometers over the course of a 300-day cruise to
      reach Mars on 12 September 1997 [JPLD-12088].

      Upon reaching Mars, MGS fired its main rocket engine for a
      25-minute Mars orbit insertion (MOI) burn.  This maneuver
      slowed the spacecraft and allowed the planet's gravity to
      capture it into orbit.  Initially, MGS whirled around the
      red planet in a highly elliptical orbit that took 45 hours
      to complete.

      After orbit insertion, MGS performed a series of orbit changes
      to drop the low point of its orbit into the upper fringes of
      the Martian atmosphere at an altitude of about 110 kilometers.
      During every atmospheric pass, the spacecraft slowed by a small
      amount because of air resistance.  This slowing caused the
      spacecraft to lose altitude on its next pass through the
      orbit's high point.  MGS was to use this aerobraking technique
      over a period of four months to lower the high point of its
      orbit from 56,000 km to near 400 km in altitude, resulting in
      a nearly circular orbit for mapping.

      At the low point of orbit 15, on October 8, 1997, the spacecraft
      experienced difficulties later diagnosed as due to excess
      vibrations of one of the solar panels. The problem was
      associated with a fracture of a panel damper arm
      [ALBEEETAL1998]. While an evaluation of the solar array problem
      was underway, periapsis was raised to about 172 km on October
      13, 1997 and remained near that altitude until November 7, 1997
      (orbits 19 through 36). During this 26-day period the spacecraft
      instrument panel was pointed towards Mars during close
      approaches (i.e., near periapsis) and the first extensive set
      of science observations from MGS was collected. Orbits 19
      through 36 are known as the Assessment Orbits or the
      Aerobraking Hiatus. The science observations were acquired
      during the descending leg of each orbit; that is, as the
      spacecraft moved from north to south.

      Aerobraking was restarted on November 8, 1997 (orbit 37), but
      with a periapsis approximately 10 km higher than that previously
      used.  Aerobraking was then conducted at about 1/3 the rate
      originally planned, placing the spacecraft in a 2 AM
      Sun-synchronous mapping orbit by March 1999 rather than the
      planned 2 PM mapping orbit in March 1998. (The 2 PM orbit meant
      that the spacecraft would have crossed the equator in the
      descending leg of the orbit -- north to south -- at 2 PM, a
      desirable time for data collection for some instruments. This
      orbit could not be achieved given the new orbital
      characteristics. However, a 2 AM orbit was satisfactory because
      if the descending leg of the orbit crossed the equator at 2 AM,
      it meant that the ascending leg, south to north, crossed the
      equator at the desired time of 2 PM.)

      Aerobraking was halted again on March 27, 1998, and resumed on
      September 24, 1998. The period from March 27 through April 28 is
      known as Science Phasing Orbit 1 (SPO-1, orbits 202 through
      268). Solar conjunction occurred between April 29 and May 27,
      followed by Science Phasing Orbit 2 (SPO-2, orbits 329-573)
      from May 28 through September 23. This second aerobraking hiatus
      was necessary to ensure that the final two-hour circular orbit
      would have an equatorial crossing time of 2 AM. A final period
      of aerobraking began September 24, 1998, and ended February 4,
      1999. The spacecraft then began mapping on March 9, 1999.
      During mapping operations, the spacecraft orbited Mars with
      a period of about 118 minutes, at an average altitude of 400 km.
      The mapping phase of the mission lasted for approximately
      one Mars year, ending January 31, 2001. This date marks the end
      of the MGS primary mission.

      An extended mission will run from February 1, 2001, through
      April 22, 2002. Mapping operations will continue during the
      extended mission in much the same way as they were conducted
      during the primary mission, with ongoing data acquisition from
      all science instruments and the radio science experiment.

      The spacecraft is three-axis stabilized and powered by solar
      cells.  It is built of lightweight composite materials
      and divided into four sub-assemblies: the equipment module,
      the propulsion module, the solar array support structure, and
      the high-gain antenna support structure.  Most science
      instruments were bolted to a nadir equipment deck.

      Mars Global Surveyor carries four on-board science instruments.
      The Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) has both a wide-angle mode for
      global coverage and a narrow-angle mode with resolution of 1.4
      meters [MALINETAL1992].  The Thermal Emission Spectrometer
      (TES) measures infrared radiation.  TES is used to determine
      the general mineral composition of patches of ground as small
      as 9.0 square kilometers; in addition, TES also scans the
      Martian atmosphere to provide data for the study of the clouds
      and weather [CHRISTENSENETAL1992].  The Magnetometer and
      Electron Reflectometer (MAG/ER) are used to measure the global
      magnetic properties of Mars, which provided insight on internal
      structure [ACUNAETAL1992].  The Mars Orbiting Laser Altimeter
      (MOLA) gathers data that allow calculation of surface
      feature heights to accuracies of 30 meters [ZUBERETAL1992].

      An ultra-stable oscillator (USO) in conjunction with
      the on-board telecommunications equipment and ground equipment
      at stations of the NASA Deep Space Network (DSN) make up the
      Radio Science Subsystem (RSS).  RSS measurements include radio
      tracking of the spacecraft to improve the gravity field model
      of Mars and radio occultation observations to study the
      structure of the atmosphere [TYLERETAL1992].

      A sixth 'instrument' is the Mars Relay, a cylindrically
      shaped antenna that will be used to collect data transmitted
      to Surveyor from landers on the Martian surface. These landers
      will be carried to Mars by later spacecraft and operated after
      completion of the MGS primary mission (late January 2001).

      A seventh instrument is the Accelerometer which measures the
      deceleration of the spacecraft as it passes through the
      atmosphere. These quantities can then be reduced to atmospheric
      density. Knowing the density and the altitude, pressures and
      temperatures can be derived for the Martian atmosphere.


    Mission Phases
    ==============
      Six mission phases were originally defined for significant
      spacecraft activity periods. These were the Pre-Launch, Launch,
      Cruise, Orbit Insertion, Mapping, and Relay Phases.  The Cruise
      Phase included both Inner and Outer Cruise components.  Once
      every seven Martian days during the Mapping Phase, the
      spacecraft approximately retraced its ground track; these
      88-orbit intervals are known as 'repeat cycles.'

      The final mission phase, Relay, was intended to support the 1998
      Mars Polar Lander and possibly the Mars 2001 Lander. It was
      planned to run from February 1, 2001, through January 1, 2003.
      Since the Mars Polar Lander was lost and the 2001 mission was
      reconfigured without a lander, MGS is no longer needed for
      relay.  Instead, the Extended Mission replaces Relay as the
      sixth mission phase.

      PRELAUNCH
      ---------
        The Prelaunch Phase extended from beginning of the MGS
        mission until the start of the launch countdown at the
        Kennedy Space Center.

        Mission Phase Start Time       : 1994-10-12
        Mission Phase Stop Time        : 1996-11-06


      LAUNCH
      ------
        The Launch Phase extended from the start of launch countdown
        until completion of the injection into the Earth-Mars
        trajectory.

        Mission Phase Start Time       : 1996-11-06
        Mission Phase Stop Time        : 1996-11-07


      CRUISE
      ------
        The Cruise Phase extended from injection into the Earth-Mars
        trajectory until Mars orbit insertion.  During the Inner
        Cruise sub-phase, MGS aimed its solar panels toward the Sun
        and communicated through its low-gain antenna; during
        the Outer Cruise sub-phase, the high-gain antenna could be
        used while the solar panels generated acceptable levels of
        power.  The transition occurred on 1997-01-09.

        Mission Phase Start Time       : 1996-11-07
        Mission Phase Stop Time        : 1997-09-12


      ORBIT INSERTION
      ---------------
        The Mars Orbit Insertion Phase began on 1997-09-12.
        It was during this phase that the problem with the solar
        panel was discovered, as described above, and aerobraking
        was halted while the problem was assessed. The original
        schedule for aerobraking was then revised to proceed more
        slowly than planned, in order to put less stress on the
        solar panel arm. Aerobraking ended in early February 1999
        and was followed by a Gravity Calibration Orbit, various
        other calibration activities, and trajectory adjustments
        to put the spacecraft into the mapping orbit.

      MAPPING
      -------
        The Mapping Phase is the period of concentrated science data
        acquisition.  At the beginning of this phase, orbit numbering
        was restarted at 1. The Mapping Phase is planned to
        last for 695 days, a little more than one Martian year.

        As a risk reduction measure against possible problems with the
        deployment of the High-Gain Antenna, the first 20 days of the
        Mapping Phase were operated in so-called 'Fixed High-Gain
        Antenna' or FHGA mode.  In this mode, the undeployed HGA was
        pointed at Earth for four to five orbits out of every twelve
        to transmit data.  During data transmission, the science
        instruments were not pointed at Mars.  The HGA was deployed on
        1999-03-29, and the first day of full mapping was 1999-04-03.

        Soon after the antenna was deployed (1999-04-16) its
        azimuth gimbal jammed, causing an entry into contingency mode
        and interruption in the acquisition of science data.  This
        interruption lasted until 1999-04-29, and then data were
        acquired in a modified FHGA mode (HGA deployed, but boresight
        fixed in the spacecraft +x direction) until 1999-05-06, when
        normal mapping resumed.  It was determined that the restricted
        range of travel on the azimuth gimbal would allow normal
        mapping operations until early 2000.

        So-called 'beta supplement mode' operations, in which the
        antenna was reoriented to allow Earth tracking during data
        acquisition, were begun on 2000-02-07. But beta supplement
        mode required that the antenna be 'rewound' while the
        spacecraft was being tracked and precluded collection of
        egress (exit) radio occultations.

        Approximately three days of FHGA operation were inserted into
        the schedule (2000-03-05 to 2000-03-07) to mitigate impact on
        radio science. Unexpected heating of MOLA resulted, and
        further FHGA operation was suspended pending resolution of the
        thermal problems.

        Mission Phase Start Time       : 1999-03-09
        Mission Phase Stop Time        : 2001-01-31


      EXTENDED MISSION
      ----------------
        The Extended Mission Phase will begin at the end of the
        Mapping Phase, 1 February 2001, and continue through 22 April
        2002.  Mapping operations will continue in much the same way
        as operations during the Mapping Phase, with data acquisition
        expected to continue as before for all science experiments.
        A new type of spacecraft maneuver has been designed for
        targeted science observations during the extended mission: the
        Roll Only Targeted Observation (ROTO). The maneuver is
        constrained to occur primarily in the roll axis and cannot
        exceed +/- 25 degrees off nadir. The spacecraft will be
        rolled during selected orbits to acquire off-nadir contiguous
        MOC, MOLA, and TES data, which will be used primarily to
        support landing site certification for future missions.

  MISSION_OBJECTIVES_SUMMARY      = "

    One of the most intriguing, unanswered scientific questions is
    why do Earth and Mars appear different today?  At the time of
    their formation several billion years ago, Mars and Earth shared
    similar conditions.  Both planets harbored vast quantities of
    surface water, thick atmospheres, and climates warmer than at
    present.  Today, Earth is a lush world filled with a countless
    number of animal and plant species.  In contrast, data gathered
    from Mars prior to MGS showed that the planet was trapped in
    conditions reminiscent of a global ice age.  The dry and
    seemingly lifeless Martian surface makes the Sahara look like
    an ocean in comparison, and average daily temperatures make
    Antarctica seen balmy.  Comparing the history and evolution of
    the two planets yields clues into Earth's past and possibly
    its future.

    Science objectives for the failed Mars Observer Mission
    [ALBEEETAL1992] were essentially identical to those for Mars
    Global Surveyor.


    Basic Measurements and Data Collection
    ======================================
      Although several spacecraft preceded MGS to Mars, fundamental
      measurements remain to be made.  No topographic model of
      the planet exists at the 100 meter level (and many areas were
      uncertain by kilometers); MOLA will provide one with typical
      accuracies of 30 m.  Preliminary measurements on the magnetic
      field have been carried out by early spacecraft; but MGS MAG/ER
      is the first instrument to carry out a systematic mapping
      effort.  Gravity models have been compiled from Mariner 9 and
      Viking data, but MGS RSS provides an order of magnitude
      improvement in these -- leading to improved understanding of
      the planet's interior.


    Atmospheric Processes
    =====================
      Despite its forbidding climate, surface temperatures on Mars
      resemble the Earth's more than any other planet.  These
      similarities in temperature result in part from the fact that
      Mars orbits the Sun only slightly farther out than the Earth as
      compared to other planets.  For example, the ground at some
      locations near Mars' equator may warm up to as high as 25C
      at noontime.  However, daytime temperatures still average well
      below freezing, and night temperatures dip much lower.

      Martian temperatures may seem almost inviting to the seasoned
      outdoors explorer, but the composition of the atmosphere leaves
      much to be desired from a human perspective.  Most of the
      martian air consists of carbon dioxide (CO2), similar to
      conditions on Venus.  If breathing carbon dioxide seems
      uninviting, the density of the air will appear worse.  Average
      barometric pressures on Mars are lower than that found at
      Earth's sea level by a factor of more than 125.  In other
      words, the air at the surface of Mars is thinner than that
      found on Earth at an altitude 19 times higher than Denver,
      Colorado.

      The extremely thin Martian air directly impacts the mystery of
      potential life on Mars, either in the past or present.  The
      reason is that almost all of the water lies trapped in the
      Martian polar ice caps or frozen beneath the surface.  Liquid
      water cannot exist on the surface because the thin atmosphere
      will cause melting ice to evaporate directly into water vapor.

      Despite the hostile composition, density, and temperature by
      today's standards on Earth, the atmosphere of Mars is both
      interesting and dynamic.  MGS objectives in this area include
      recording global daily images of the planet so that cloud
      patterns can be followed and the growth of dust storms can
      be monitored over a full martian year.  TES and RSS are both
      able to measure vertical structure within the atmosphere,
      another key to understanding transport of material within the
      atmosphere -- including precipitation of CO2 itself on the
      winter polar cap.


    Surface Processes
    =================
      Geologically, Mars is one of the most interesting planets in
      the Solar System.  Although only half the diameter of Earth,
      Mars maintains large water and CO2 ice caps at the poles, a
      canyon much deeper than the Grand Canyon and longer than the
      contiguous 48 United States are wide, crater valleys as
      large as the western United States, and a handful of monstrous
      volcanoes that make Mount Everest appear tiny in comparison.

      A study of Martian geology is crucial toward revealing clues
      into the history of the Earth.  Mars is the only planet in the
      solar system that both has an atmosphere, and contains surface
      features that cover almost the entire range of history.  On
      Earth, pristine rocks and other surface features from
      the first billion years of our planet's existence do not exist
      because geological events, weather, and life have caused
      drastic alterations.  Because Earth and Mars shared similar
      conditions near the time of their formation, the MGS
      exploration of Mars allows us to take a peek into Earth's
      past in a way not possible by studying the Earth by itself.

      Although liquid water on Mars will quickly evaporate,
      photographs transmitted back to Earth by NASA missions prior
      to MGS revealed giant flood channels, dry river beds, and
      flood plains on the surface.  This evidence of past water on
      Mars led some scientists to consider Mars as the prime
      location in the Solar System to search for extraterrestrial
      life.  The speculation was that because Mars once possessed
      a thicker atmosphere and vast quantities of surface water
      billions of years ago, then the planet may have harbored
      conditions favorable to the formation of life despite its
      present forbidding climate.

      Viking and Mars Pathfinder returned information on elemental
      composition of some Mars surface materials at specific
      landing sites.  But regional and global information is needed
      to understand both the current state and history of rocky
      surfaces.  MOC will provide high-resolution image data; TES
      will acquire spectral signatures of rock units so that thermal
      inertia, surface rock distributions, and composition could
      be inferred.


    Search for Life
    ===============
      Sensors aboard various NASA spacecraft launched to Mars over
      the 30 years prior to MGS showed that advanced life forms
      almost certainly do not exist on the planet today.  However,
      many felt that the planet might hide bacterial forms of life
      or their fossil remains.  Although Mars Global Surveyor will
      not conduct a search for life on Mars, it will gather detailed
      data that will help in understanding the mystery of the
      missing water.  This type of study will provide important
      background data to help scientists in their search for
      Martian life on future missions.


    Other Studies
    =============
      In addition to studying Mars, the spacecraft could also be
      used for experiments of opportunity, such as searching for
      gravitational waves during cruise [ESTABROOKETAL1995] and
      probing the Sun's corona during solar conjunction [WOO1993]."
