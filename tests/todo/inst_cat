  Instrument Overview
  ===================

  The principal components of MOLA are a diode-pumped, Nd:YAG laser
  transmitter that emits 1.064 micrometer wavelength laser pulses, a
  0.5 m diameter telescope, a silicon avalanche photodiode detector,
  and a time interval unit with 10 nsec resolution. Additional delay
  fibers increase the effective resolution to 2.5 ns. When in the
  Mapping Phase of the mission, MOLA provides measurements of the
  topography of Mars within approximately 160 m footprints and a
  center-to-center along-track footprint spacing of 300 m along the
  MGS nadir ground-track.  Range measurements, with an effective
  resolution of 37 cm, are converted to profiles of planetary radius
  and topographic height after correction for orbit and pointing errors.
  Radial accuracy of individual profiles is approximately 1 m RMS, as
  determined by altimetric crossovers, and shot locations are determined
  to within 100 m in the along-track and across-track directions.
  MOLA profiles have been assembled into global grids referenced to Mars'
  center-of-mass, with resolutions of up to 1/128 degree per pixel,
  although at this density some interpolation is required across-track.
  Other standard data products will include near-global grids of
  footprint-scale roughness and 1.064 micrometer surface reflectivity.
  The background solar illumination noise level provides seasonal maps
  of narrow-band Lambert albedo.

  All components of MOLA except for the laser and telescope have been
  designed, built and tested at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center,
  Greenbelt, MD.


  MOLA Science Objectives
  =======================

  The primary MOLA objective is to determine globally the topography
  of Mars at a level suitable for addressing problems in geology and
  geophysics [ZUBERETAL1992, SMITHETAL1998].  Secondary objectives
  include characterizing the 1.064 micrometer wavelength surface
  reflectivity of Mars to contribute to analyses of global surface
  mineralogy and seasonal albedo changes.  Other objectives include
  addressing problems in atmospheric circulation and providing
  geodetic control and topographic context for the assessment of
  possible future Mars landing sites.

  Operational Considerations
  ==========================

  The MOLA instrument measures the round-trip time of flight of
  infrared laser pulses transmitted from the MGS spacecraft to the
  martian surface.  The instrument normally operates in a single
  autonomous mode, in which it will produce ranging measurements.
  Surface topography estimates can be derived from these data, given
  appropriate corrections for the position and attitude of the
  spacecraft.

  MOLA's transmitter is a Q-switched, Nd:YAG laser oscillator which is
  pumped by a 44 bar laser array.  Each bar contains ~1000 AlGaAs
  (Aluminum, Gallium Arsenide) laser diodes.  The Q-switch controls
  the emission of the laser, and Nd:YAG refers to the composition of
  the material that is optically excited to produce laser action:
  Neodymium-doped Yttrium Aluminum Garnet. The laser emits 8.5-ns-wide
  (full width at half the maximum pulse amplitude, FWHM) pulses at
  1.064 micrometers. The pulse repetition rate is 10 Hz, and the
  pulse energy was 48 mJ at the beginning of the Mapping Phase
  and 20 mJ at the end of its operation. The laser consumed 13.7 W
  when operating, and its on-orbit lifetime was 6.7x10^8 laser
  pulses (~2 years) when the laser firing signal ceased. The failure
  was traced to loss of gain in a transistor circuit driving the 100 MHz
  ovenized crystal oscillator, probably a result of aging and radiation
  damage.

  The development of a space-qualified, long-lifetime laser represents
  one of the primary engineering challenges associated with MOLA.  For
  comparison, the ruby flashlamp laser altimeters flown on the Apollo
  15, 16 and 17 missions [KAULAETAL1972, KAULAETAL1973, KAULAETAL1974]
  each operated for less than 10^4 laser pulses.  High
  pulse-repetition-rate lasers with lifetimes on the order of 10^9
  shots have been made possible due to breakthroughs in solid-state
  laser technology, resulting in improvements in the peak power,
  brightness, and availability of semiconductor diodes and arrays
  [CROSSETAL1987, BYERETAL1988].  The key technological advance has
  been the replacement of the flashlamp, which is the device that has
  traditionally been used to pump optical energy into the laser rod,
  with a highly efficient array of laser diodes.  While flashlamp
  lasers fail catastrophically, diode-pumped lasers such as MOLA's
  instead undergo a gradual degradation in energy output as individual
  pump diodes fail.  Laser diodes also produce the required pump
  energy only in a narrow region near the laser rod's absorption band,
  which dramatically improves the laser's electrical to optical
  efficiency."
