      is mosaicked into 1964 non-overlapping tiles each containing multiple
      strips of mapping data. Their longitude width increases poleward to
      keep tiles approximately the same in area. The adopted projection
      convention is planetocentric, positive east, using the 2000 IAU prime
      meridian and pole of rotation. The projection varies in 5 degree
      using EQUIRECTANGULAR equatorward of 87.5 degrees latitude, and POLAR
      latitude bands, STEREOGRAPHIC poleward of 87.5 degrees latitude. From
      the equator toward the north pole, for example, the bins are -2.5
      to 2.5, 2.5 to 7.5, 7.5 to 12.5, etc. Versions 1 and 3 were 256
      pixels per degree. Version 4 is 327 pixels per degree.

      For the latitude band projected equirectangularly, the
      CENTER_LATITUDE of projection is the central latitude of
      each band to minimize 'distortion.' For the three latitude bands
      given above, the central latitudes are 0.0, 5.0, and 10.0.

      The transformation from latitude and longitude to line and
      sample is given by the following equations:

      LINE = int(LINE_PROJECTION_OFFSET - lat*MAP_RESOLUTION)

      SAMPLE = int(SAMPLE_PROJECTION_OFFSET - lon*MAP_RESOLUTION)

      where lat = latitude and lon = longitude.
      Note that integral values of line and sample correspond to the
      center of a pixel. Lat and lon are the latitude and longitude of a
      given location on the surface, east positive.

      MAP_RESOLUTION= the map resolution in pixels per degree,
      256 pixels/degree for version 1 and 3, and 327 pixels/degree for
      version 4.

      LINE_PROJECTION_OFFSET is the line number minus the line on which
      the map projection origin occurs. For an EQUIRECTANGULAR map
      projection, origin is the equatorward edge of the map tile.
      The value of LINE_PROJECTION_OFFSET is positive for
      images starting north of the equator and is negative for images
      starting south of the equator.

      SAMPLE_PROJECTION_OFFSET is the nearest sample number to the left of
      the projection longitude. For an EQUIRECTANGULAR map
      projection, the value of SAMPLE_PROJECTION_OFFSET is
      positive for images starting to the west of the projection longitude
      and is negative for images starting to the east of the projection
      longitude.

      MAP_RESOLUTION is measured in pixels/degree.

      MAP_SCALE is measured in km/pixel and is an average.

      There are four PDS parameters that specify the latitude and
      longitude boundaries of an image.  MAXIMUM_LATITUDE and
      MINIMUM_LATITUDE specify the latitude boundaries of the image, and
      EASTERNMOST_LONGITUDE and WESTERNMOST_LONGITUDE specify the
      longitudinal boundaries of the map.

      Definitions of other mapping parameters can be found in the PDS Data
      dictionary."
