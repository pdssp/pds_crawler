Purpose
-------

This user manual provides instructions for using the :term:`PDS` web crawler, which is a
tool for extracting data from :term:`PDS` archive and web service and transforming it
into a format compatible with :term:`STAC` format.

The goal is then to ingest the :term:`STAC` data into the :term:`PDSSP` hub to make it available
in the infrastructure. This ingestion allows to answer two use cases:

* knowing the available data
* to select these data to send them to online processing services

Context
-------

The Planetary Surfaces Data and Services Pole is a research infrastructure dedicated
to the management and distribution of data and services related to the surface of
planets and celestial bodies. The pole is managed by the French National Center for
Space Studies (CNES), in collaboration with other international research institutions
and organizations.

The Planetary Surfaces Data and Services Pole provides scientists, engineers, and
end-users with easy and quick access to high-quality data and services for the study
of the surface of different planets and celestial bodies. It also offers tools and
resources for the visualization, analysis, and interpretation of this data.

The data and services available through the Planetary Surfaces Data and Services Pole
cover a wide range of research areas, such as geology, topography, meteorology, mapping,
imaging, spectroscopy, and modeling. The main sources of data are space missions and
ground-based telescopes, such as Mars Express, Venus Express, the Mars Reconnaissance
Orbiter (MRO), NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) mission, as well as other
space exploration missions.
