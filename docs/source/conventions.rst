Conventions
===========

This document uses the Unified Modeling Language (UML), which is a standardized graphical
modeling language widely used in the field of software engineering. UML modeling provides
a visual framework for describing various aspects of a software system, including its
structure, behavior, and interactions with users and other systems, using a variety of
modeling diagrams.

Use case diagram
================

A use case is a kind of behaviored classifier that specifies a [complete] unit
of [useful] functionality performed by [one or more] subjects to which the use
case applies in collaboration with one or more actors, and which [for complete use cases]
yields an observable result that is of some value to those actors [or other stakeholders]
of each subject.

Class diagram
=============

Class diagram is UML structure diagram which shows structure of the designed system at the
level of classes and interfaces, shows their features, constraints and relationships -
associations, generalizations, dependencies, etc.

Sequence diagram
================

Sequence diagram describes an interaction by focusing on the sequence of messages that are
exchanged, along with their corresponding occurrence specifications on the lifelines.


.. note::

    An example of stylistic conventions is using
    boldface and courier font to distinguish user
    input. Examples of syntax conventions are the
    rules for combining commands, keywords and
    parameters.
