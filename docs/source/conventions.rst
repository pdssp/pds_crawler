*The* :term:`SUM` *shall summarise symbols, stylistics conventions, and command \
syntax conventions used in the document.*

.. note::

    An example of stylistic conventions is using
    boldface and courier font to distinguish user
    input. Examples of syntax conventions are the
    rules for combining commands, keywords and
    parameters.
